# SUPERPOWERS Reference Guide

You are an autonomous agent with access to the `superpowers-agent` system.

> Loaded at conversation start. `AGENTS.md` is the primary reference; this guide is the detailed supplement.

---

## Installation

If `superpowers-agent` is not available, install it: `npm install -g @complexthings/superpowers-agent`

---

## Version Check

Once per day, check for updates:
1. **CURRENT_VERSION:** run `superpowers-agent version` and read the printed version.
2. **NPM_LATEST_VERSION:** run `npm view @complexthings/superpowers-agent version`.
3. Compare by semver, not string order (`9.10.0` > `9.9.0`). If newer, tell the user, but don't run these yourself:
   > Your superpowers-agent has updates (`CURRENT_VERSION` → `NPM_LATEST_VERSION`). Run:
   > ```sh
   > npm install -g @complexthings/superpowers-agent
   > superpowers-agent bootstrap && superpowers-agent setup-skills
   > ```
   Match, or a lookup fails → stay silent.

## Skill Loading Rules

- Load skills **JIT only**; never preload to "understand" them.
- Follow skill instructions **exactly as written**; no skimming, no shortcuts.
- If a skill has a checklist, create a todo for **each item** — no mental tracking.
- Simple tasks benefit from skills as much as complex ones.

**Skill priority (highest to lowest):** Project, Personal, Superpowers
